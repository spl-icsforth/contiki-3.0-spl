Command type is defined in cmd_index of cmd_request_t

The cmd_index field has the following structure.

---------------------------------
| x | S | C | A | x | E | F | s |
---------------------------------
MSB   ------------------>     LSB

s: start collection (1)
F: change frequency
x: reserved
A: connect to Arduino (or in general external device via uart0
C: callibration (0) or measurement (1)
S: sensor 1 (0) or sensor 2 (1)
E: error on cmd parameters (1)
Valid commands:
0x00: STOP
0x01: start nm only using the default sampling rate
0x02: change the sampling rate of nm
0x03: start nm only using a user-defined sampling rate
0x11: start nm+biofilm with sensor 1.
0x12: change the sampling rate of the biofilm sensor only
0x13: start nm+biofilm with sensor 1 using a user-defined sampling rate
0x51: start nm+biofilm with sensor 2.
0x53: start nm+biofilm with sensor 2 using a user-defined sampling rate

0x30: get measurement from sensor 1 (on demand)
0x70: get measurement from sensor 2 (on demand)

0xFF: uart connection error code (for uplink)
